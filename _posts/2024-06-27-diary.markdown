### Branch Prefixes
Using prefixes in branch names helps to quickly identify the purpose of the branches. Here are some common types of branches with their corresponding prefixes:

Feature Branches
> These branches are used for developing new features. Use the prefix feature/. For instance, feature/login-system.

Bugfix Branches
> These branches are used to fix bugs in the code. Use the prefix bugfix/. For example, bugfix/header-styling.

Hotfix Branches
> These branches are made directly from the production branch to fix critical bugs in the production environment. Use the prefix hotfix/. For instance, hotfix/critical-security-issue.

Release Branches
> These branches are used to prepare for a new production release. They allow for last-minute dotting of i’s and crossing t’s. Use the prefix release/. For example, release/v1.0.1.

Documentation Branches
> These branches are used to write, update, or fix documentation. Use the prefix docs/. For instance, docs/api-endpoints.
